STRUCTURE
=========
###Warning - extremely buggy
Currently functions perfectly as a build process tool. In-browser editing functionality is currently in development.

Edit your site in the browser. 

Click an element you want to edit and structure will serve all SCSS files that contain the element's selectors. You can now live edit your precompiled styles.
